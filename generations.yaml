    description: "The original Hyundai Genesis Coupe marked the brand's first serious entry into the sports car segment, representing a significant departure from their previous offerings. Built on a rear-wheel drive platform shared with the Genesis sedan, it featured aggressive styling with a long hood, short deck proportions, and distinctive 'Z-shaped' character line along the flanks. Initially powered by either a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 210 HP or a 3.8L V6 with 306 HP, both available with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was driver-focused with supportive seats, a simple instrument panel, and basic but functional controls. Handling was emphasized with a sport-tuned suspension, limited-slip differential on some models, and Brembo brakes available on higher trims. This early version established the Genesis Coupe as a legitimate sports car offering genuine performance at a value price point, though interior quality and refinement lagged behind some competitors."

    end_year: 2016
    description: "The refreshed Genesis Coupe featured significant updates to both styling and powertrains. Exterior changes included a more aggressive front fascia with a larger grille, redesigned headlights, and hood heat extractors. Powertrain upgrades were substantial, with the 2.0L turbocharged engine now producing 274 HP and the 3.8L V6 increased to 348 HP, both offering more competitive performance. An 8-speed automatic transmission option replaced the previous 6-speed unit. The interior received improved materials, redesigned gauges with electroluminescent lighting, and a new multifunction steering wheel. Additional refinements included retuned suspension for better handling, reduced NVH (noise, vibration, harshness), and expanded feature content. This update addressed many of the criticisms of the original version, delivering more performance and refinement while maintaining the value proposition. The Genesis Coupe was discontinued after 2016 without a direct replacement, as the Genesis brand separated from Hyundai and repositioned as a luxury marque with its own distinct model lineup. During its production, the Genesis Coupe established Hyundai's credibility in the performance segment and helped change perceptions of the brand among enthusiasts."
